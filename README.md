# clojure-maven-project

a starter project for Clojure using Maven.

Clojure, a Lisp dialect that runs on the JVM.

well-suited for creating Domain Specific Languages (DSLs).

Gradle is powerful because it uses flexible DSLs written in Kotlin or Groovy that allows high customization over build scripts.  

Never judge me for these starter projects. write a good readme.
